    A dead simple npm library to validate express.js response status codes.
</p>

## Inspiration for this package!

1. To learn how to make packages üòâ
2. I spent around 40-50 minutes debugging why [SRMKZILLA's](https://srmkzilla.net) backend kept crashing. Found out someone passed the mongo error codes(single digit) to express and viola. 

## What does it do?

It does what a middleware should, it sits quietly and on a day to day basis, you never notice it. Express is great, but it can be better. In TypeScript, passing a wrong status code is not that easy. But in JavaScript? One could pass a tank and the code would run (Thanks JS :) ). This package safeguards your app from throwing unwanted errors or crashing. What can you pass? 

1. If you pass a valid status code like 200, it works. It doesn't change anything in the original status code. 
2. BUT, if you pass "200" or "200OK", it converts it to 200 and sends it. But what if you pass something like 799 (invalid status code)? In that case a default status code is set and sent.
3. And you guesses correct, you can easily set the default status code you want. 

## Examples: 

We are in the process of adding more examples and testing this library to make sure it works smoothly everywhere. Currently we have the following examples (Shoutout to [Harshit Singh, my roommate :p](https://github.com/whiletrueee) for being the first user of this library) :
